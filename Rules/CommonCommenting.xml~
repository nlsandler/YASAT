    <Description>Often developers will make notes in source to remind themselves to return to a block of code due to a known issue or bug.</Description>
    <RealPositiveExamples>
      <Example>//I should remember to fix this terrible bug that will break everything.</Example>
      <Example>///Oh, look at this code I have written.</Example>
      <Example>#Whatever shall I do about it?</Example>
      <!--The following examples probably need their own extension-specific rules.-->
      <Example>-- Clearly I must be a terrible programmer.</Example>
      <Example>' Otherwise my code wouldn't be full of all of these comments.</Example>
      <Example>TODO: take all comments out of this code.</Example>
      <Example>FIXME: Remove all of the comments.</Example>
      <Example>BUGBUG: Derp derp, I am putting silly things in my code.</Example>
      <Example>XXX: Is this a thing people use to indicate their code was buggy? I figured it just meant the code was NSFW.</Example>
      <Example>DEBUG: Verb. To pick out bugs.</Example>
      <Example>HACK: This needs fixin'. </Example>
      <Example>NOTE: Duly noted.</Example>

    <!--No false positives included at the moment; I don't think that can be captured easily by regular expressions.-->
    <!--However, putting "problem" comments" and "normal" comments (e.g. // vs. FIXME) in different rules might be useful. -->
